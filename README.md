## Overview

AstroTerra is an advanced framework designed to analyze the lunar plane by utilizing image processing and machine learning techniques. With a focus on detecting and mapping surface depressions, AstroTerra operates on high-resolution images captured by the Orbiter High-Resolution Camera (OHRC), deployed in ISRO's Chandrayaan-2 mission.<br><br>

The primary objective is to streamline moon crater detection and support rover navigation. Given the enormous dataset generated by lunar missions, manual analysis is impractical. AstroTerra addresses this gap using a deep learning-based approach that combines pattern recognition with intelligent pathfinding algorithms.

## Key Features<br>

- **Automated Crater Detection**: Utilizing YOLOv8l deep learning model optimized on a self-labeled dataset<br>
- **Efficient Processing**: Handles ultra-high-resolution OHRC images (12,000 Ã— 90,148 pixels)<br>
- **Intelligent Path Planning**: A* algorithm implementation for optimal rover trajectory planning<br>
- **Box Map Analysis**: Combines overlapping bounding boxes into unified crater regions<br>
- **Pixel-to-Lunar Coordinate Mapping**: Ensures precise geospatial alignment

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Gathering**: Acquire lunar surface imagery from OHRC with ultra-high-resolution (12,000 Ã— 90,148 pixels)<br>
2. **Image Segmentation**: Divide images into smaller, manageable 1,000 Ã— 1,000-pixel tiles<br>
3. **Preprocessing**: Enhance image quality through noise reduction and contrast enhancement<br>
4. **Dataset Annotation**: Label crater features using ImageLabelingTool<br>
5. **Model Training**: Fine-tune YOLOv8l model on the annotated dataset<br>
6. **Coordinate Transformation**:Map geospatial coordinates to image pixel indices<br>
7. **Assembly**: Combine processed tiles back into large mosaics<br>
8. **Grid Visualization**: Using 2D binary array (0/1) it overcomes the issue of overlapping bounding boxes and adds safety margins<br>
9. **Path Finding**: Implement A* algorithm to determine optimal routes between points
10. **Efficient coordinates mapping**: Uses Hash-maps to map coordinates optimized the efficiency from o(n^2) to o(1)
